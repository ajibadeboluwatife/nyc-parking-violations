# NYC Parking Violations Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes NYC parking violations to uncover trends, predict high-risk areas, and develop insights to improve parking enforcement and policies.

### 🔥 Key Features:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, standardizing formats.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identifying trends, seasonal patterns, and geographical hotspots.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Predicting potential violation zones.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Visualizing key insights with an easy-to-use UI.

## 📊 Data Source
- **Dataset:** NYC Open Data - Parking Violations Issued ([Link](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/))
- **Size:** Millions of records from multiple years
- **Key Features:** Date, Time, Violation Type, Fine Amount, Location, Vehicle Type

## 📈 Key Insights
✔️ Most frequent violations: `No Parking - Street Cleaning`, `Expired Meter`, `Fire Hydrant`
✔️ Peak violation times: `Morning Rush Hours (7 AM - 10 AM)`
✔️ Highest fined areas: `Manhattan`, `Downtown Brooklyn`
✔️ Yearly fine collections exceed **$500M+**

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
- **Classification Models:** Random Forest, XGBoost (to predict violation types)
- **Time Series Forecasting:** ARIMA, LSTM (to predict future violations)
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Folium, GeoPandas (to visualize high-risk areas)

---

## 📊 Interactive Dashboard
> 🚀 Coming Soon! This will include:
- Heatmaps of violation hotspots
- Trend visualizations over time
- Predictive modeling results
